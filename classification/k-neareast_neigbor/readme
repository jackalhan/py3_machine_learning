if we have two groups, one of them is full of + signs. and the other one is full of - signs. -
these two groups are in our data set, the important point is we need to develop a function to find these groups
therefore, k-nearest neighbour or similar function is very important to detect the other values in the dataset to set them
in right group.

What is K-nearest neighbours?

Decide what the K number is going to be?
    Let us say that K=2 ;

which equals to closest 2 points to point that is somewhere in the dataset.

There may be some cases which a selected point can be somewhere between two different groups. For example
a point between + signs group and - signs group. In this case, what you need to do this generally set K to odd number
rather than an even number. Instead of 2, we should select K for example 3

If you have 3 groups, than you should set the K at least to 5.

What are the downfalls of K-Neighbours?
Distance is measured by Euclidean distance. Most simple method. To measure the distance between any given points,
and all of the other points. If you think a large dataset, this operation is very exhaustive. There are somethings
to speed up the process. Like using radius or so on.
But, for the big dataset, generally SVM (Support vector machines) is recommended. It performs
much better than k-neighbours

What is Euclidean Distance?

i = dimensions
q = one point
p = different point

square_root of (sum of (square of (qi - pi)))

example : In two dimensional axis

q = (1,3)
p = (2,5)

square_root of ((1-2)^2 + (3-5)^2)
